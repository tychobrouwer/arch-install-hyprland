# thinkfan Example Config File
# ============================
#
# Please read the config manpage thinkfan.conf(5) before playing around with
# this.
#
# This is NOT a working config file that can just be copied. It is only meant
# to give a rough idea what can be done. In particular, don't copy & paste the
# fan speed config! Think about what you're doing.
#
# If you don't know what temperatures are right for your system, you should
# not be using thinkfan!

# Sensor Drivers and Temperature Inputs
# =====================================
#
# ATTENTION: The order in which sensors are specified here is significant when
# specifying the fan speeds further below!
#
# There are multiple ways in which a temperature input can be specified. An
# example for each is given below.
#
# The "correction:" and "optional:" keywords may be specified on any type of
# sensor.

sensors:
  # LM Sensors
  # ==========
  # Temperatures can be read directly from Linux drivers through the LM sensors.
  #
  # To configure this, install "lm-sensors" and "libsensors", then
  # run "sensors-detect", then run "sensors".
  # To build thinkfan from sources, you'll also need to install "libsensors-dev"
  # or equivalent package for your distribution.
  #
  # For example, the following output of "sensors":
  # ...
  # thinkpad-isa-0000
  # Adapter: ISA adapter
  # fan1:        2618 RPM
  # fan2:        2553 RPM
  # CPU:          +63.0 C  
  # GPU 1:        +55.0 C  
  # temp3:        +68.0 C  
  # temp4:         +0.0 C  
  # temp5:        +60.0 C  
  # temp6:        +64.0 C  
  # temp7:        +67.0 C  
  # temp8:         +0.0 C  
  # ...
  # would result in the following configuration:
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/thermal
    indices: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

  # nvml: The proprietary nVidia driver
  # ===================================
  # Temperatures can be read directly from nVidia GPUs that run with the
  # proprietary driver. The "nvml:" entry must specify the PCI bus ID of the
  # GPU (can be found with lspci)
  #
  # Note that this does not work with the open-source "nouveau" driver. Open
  # source drivers should support the hwmon interface instead (see above).
  - nvml: 01:00.0

# Fan Drivers
# ===========
#
# Currently, thinkfan supports only one fan, but support for multiple fans is
# in development and will be released soon. For the time being, the examples
# given below are mutually exclusive.
#
fans:
  # tpacpi: Thinkpad-specific fan interface
  # =======================================
  # Currently, this is the only way to use disengaged and automatic mode on
  # thinkpads.
  - tpacpi: /proc/acpi/ibm/fan

##############################################################################
# Fan Speeds (simple mode)
# ========================
# 
# In simple mode, each entry is a [FANSPEED, LOWER_LIMIT, UPPER_LIMIT] tuple.
# This is a quick way to configure a small system like a laptop, where the
# temperature ratings for all monitored devices are similar. Only the highest
# temperature found across all sensors will be compared against these limits.
# All other temperatures are ignored.
#
# Correction values on individual sensors (see above) may be used to equalize
# small discrepancies in temperature ratings.
#
# The FANSPEED values in this example are valid for the thinkpad_acpi fan
# driver only (see above)
#
levels:
  - [0, 0,  41]
